          <h2>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>

          <p><strong>1.1.</strong> MERGE Media, LLC ("MMAI") provides this website at https://www.MERGE Media.ai, as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website, or Mobile App (defined below) related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the "Site"). For the avoidance of doubt, all Users (as defined below) are also Visitors. MMAI also provides its proprietary, web-based software and services ("Subscription"), as defined in the Subscription Agreement ("Agreement"), if applicable, between MMAI and the person or entity ("Customer") identified on the Agreement subject to the terms and conditions of this Terms of Service ("Terms of Service"), as may be amended from time to time by MMAI in its sole discretion. The date these Terms of Service were last updated is set forth at the top of this page. All changes to these Terms of Service are effective immediately and apply to all access to and use of the Subscription thereafter. Your continued use of the Subscription following the posting of revised Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes. As used in these Terms of Service, "you" or "You" refers to one of the following, as applicable: Customer if you are a Customer; User if you are a User; or Visitor if you are a Visitor.</p>

          <p><strong>1.2.</strong> By signing the Agreement or by accessing the Site and/or the Subscription, you represent and acknowledge: (a) you read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and the provisions of the Agreement, as applicable; (b) you are at least 18 years of age (or have reached the age of majority in the jurisdiction where you reside); and (c) that the information you provide to MMAI is accurate, complete, and is within your right to use. If Customer is a company or another legal entity, the individual signing or User accessing on behalf of the Customer represents that he or she has the authority to bind Customer and its affiliates to these Terms of Service.</p>

          <p><strong>1.3.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that these Terms of Service incorporate MMAI's then-current Privacy Policy (available at <a href="https://www.mergemedia.ai/privacy-policy">https://www.mergemedia.ai/privacy-policy</a>), which together constitute a contractual agreement between you and MMAI, are incorporated into the Agreement, and that these Terms of Service govern your use of the Site and Subscription, as applicable, and supersede any other agreements between you and MMAI governing the Subscription.</p>

          <p><strong>1.4.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that MMAI does not warrant any products or services offered through the Site or the Subscription by any third parties ("Third-Party Services"). Any exchange of data or other interaction between you and a provider of any Third-Party Services is solely between you and such third-party provider, and you shall be solely responsible for paying all applicable fees for any Third-Party Services purchased by or on behalf of you, whether such fees are directly charged to you by such third-party providers or by paying such fees to MMAI upon invoicing. The Site or the Subscription may provide, or providers of Third-Party Services may provide, links to other external world wide web or mobile sites or resources.</p>

          <p><strong>1.5.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that MMAI has no control over such external sites and resources and that MMAI is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources and does not endorse and is not liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. In addition, you agree that MMAI is not responsible for any third-party information or data that you may transmit, process or transfer to or from such third party through the Site or the Subscription (e.g., through the integration of the Site or the Subscription with any Third-Party Services).</p>

          <h2>2. PURCHASED SUBSCRIPTION; SERVICES</h2>

          <p><strong>2.1.</strong> To use the Subscription, MMAI will provide you with access credentials ("Credentials") that you will be required to enter as prompted on the Site in order to access your account and the Subscription pursuant to these Terms of Service and the Agreement. You are responsible for: (a) information submitted to the Site under your Credentials; (b) treating your Credentials as confidential, and not disclosing them to any third party; (c) the accuracy, quality, and legality of all information you submit to the Site and the means by which you acquired such information; (d) using commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Subscription; (e) promptly notifying MMAI of any unauthorized use of or access to the Subscription; and (f) providing reasonable assistance to us in investigating and preventing the recurrence of such unauthorized use or access. MMAI is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your Credentials. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Internet and the equipment necessary to use the Site or the Subscription. If you provide any information to MMAI that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, MMAI has the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Subscription and refuse any and all current or future use of the Subscription (or any portion thereof).</p>

Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service, MMAI hereby grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited license to: (a) access and use the Subscription and the Documentation, during the Subscription Term; and (b) download and install MMAI's mobile application ("Mobile App") on mobile devices owned or otherwise controlled by you (each, a "Mobile Device").

          <p><strong>3.1.

          <p><strong>3.2. Your Data Rights.</strong> Subject to the limited rights granted by you hereunder, MMAI acquires no right, title, or interest from you or your licensors under these Terms of Service in or to Your Data, including any intellectual property rights therein. You hereby grant to MMAI a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to host, store, transfer, publicly display, communicate to the public, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, create derivative works as authorized in these Terms of Service, and distribute Your Data in connection with providing the Subscription.</p>

          <h2>5. DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>

          <p>THE SITE (INCLUDING THE MOBILE APP, IF APPLICABLE) AND THE SUBSCRIPTION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" ON AN "AVAILABLE" BASIS. YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SITE OR THE SUBSCRIPTION AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND MMAI IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE OR THE SUBSCRIPTION) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, YOUR DATA.</p>
